<h1>site&#8212;Site-specific configuration hook</h1>

<p>This module is automatically imported during initialization. The
automatic import can be suppressed using the interpreter's -S
option.</p>

<p>Importing this module will append site-specific paths to the
module search path.</p>

<p>It starts by constructing up to four directories from a head and
a tail part. For the head part, it uses <code>sys.prefix</code> and
<code>sys.exec_prefix</code>; empty heads are skipped. For the tail
part, it uses the empty string (on Windows) or
lib/python2.4/site-packages (on Unix and Macintosh) and then
lib/site-python. For each of the distinct head-tail combinations,
it sees if it refers to an existing directory, and if so, adds it
to <code>sys.path</code> and also inspects the newly added path for
configuration files.</p>

<p>A path configuration file is a file whose name has the form
<var>package</var>.pth and exists in one of the four directories
mentioned above; its contents are additional items (one per line)
to be added to <code>sys.path</code>. Non-existing items are never
added to <code>sys.path</code>, but no check is made that the item
refers to a directory (rather than a file). No item is added to
<code>sys.path</code> more than once. Blank lines and lines
beginning with <code>#</code> are skipped. Lines starting with
<code>import</code> are executed.</p>

<p>For example, suppose <code>sys.prefix</code> and <code>
sys.exec_prefix</code> are set to /usr/local. The Python 2.4.2
library is then installed in /usr/local/lib/python2.4 (where only
the first three characters of <code>sys.version</code> are used to
form the installation path name). Suppose this has a subdirectory
/usr/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages with three
subsubdirectories, foo, bar and spam, and two path configuration
files, foo.pth and bar.pth. Assume foo.pth contains the
following:</p>

<pre>
# foo package configuration

foo
bar
bletch
</pre>

<p>and bar.pth contains:</p>

<pre>
# bar package configuration

bar
</pre>

<p>Then the following directories are added to <code>
sys.path</code>, in this order:</p>

<pre>
/usr/local/lib/python2.3/site-packages/bar
/usr/local/lib/python2.3/site-packages/foo
</pre>

<p>Note that bletch is omitted because it doesn't exist; the bar
directory precedes the foo directory because bar.pth comes
alphabetically before foo.pth; and spam is omitted because it is
not mentioned in either path configuration file.</p>

<p>After these path manipulations, an attempt is made to import a
module named <code>
sitecustomize</code>, which can perform arbitrary site-specific
customizations. If this import fails with an <code>exceptions.ImportError</code>
exception, it is silently ignored.</p>

<p>Note that for some non-Unix systems, <code>sys.prefix</code> and
<code>sys.exec_prefix</code> are empty, and the path manipulations
are skipped; however the import of <code>sitecustomize</code> is still attempted.</p>
