<h1>sha&#8212;SHA-1 message digest algorithm</h1>

<p>This module implements the interface to NIST's secure hash algorithm,
known as SHA-1. SHA-1 is an improved version of the original SHA hash
algorithm. It is used in the same way as the {@link md5} module: use
{@link new} to create an sha object, then feed this object with
arbitrary strings using the {@link update} method, and at any point you
can ask it for the digest of the concatenation of the strings fed to it
so far. SHA-1 digests are 160 bits instead of MD5's 128 bits.

@@function new([string])

<p>Return a new sha object. If {@var string} is present, the method call
{@code update(}{@var string}) is made.

@@text 

<p>The following values are provided as constants in the module and as
attributes of the sha objects returned by {@link new}:

@@variable blocksize

<p>Size of the blocks fed into the hash function; this is always {@code
1}. This size is used to allow an arbitrary string to be hashed.

@@variable digest_size

<p>The size of the resulting digest in bytes. This is always {@code 20}.

@@text 

<p>An sha object has the same methods as md5 objects:

@@method update(arg)

<p>Update the sha object with the string {@var arg}. Repeated calls are
equivalent to a single call with the concatenation of all the arguments:
{@code m.update(a); m.update(b)} is equivalent to {@code m.update(a+b)}.

@@method digest()

<p>Return the digest of the strings passed to the {@link update} method
so far. This is a 20-byte string which may contain non-ASCII characters,
including null bytes.

@@method hexdigest()

<p>Like {@link digest} except the digest is returned as a string of
length 40, containing only hexadecimal digits. This may be used to
exchange the value safely in email or other non-binary environments.

@@method copy()

<p>Return a copy (&#8220;clone&#8221;) of the sha object. This can be
used to efficiently compute the digests of strings that share a common
initial substring.
