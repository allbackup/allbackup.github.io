{@link check} described below.

@@function check(file_or_dir)

<p>If {@var file_or_dir} is a directory and not a symbolic link, then
recursively descend the directory tree named by {@var file_or_dir},
checking all .py files along the way. If {@var file_or_dir} is an
ordinary Python source file, it is checked for whitespace related
problems. The diagnostic messages are written to standard output using
the print statement.

incremented by the {@code -v} option if called as a script.

@@variable filename_only

<p>Flag indicating whether to print only the filenames of files
containing whitespace related problems. This is set to true by the
{@code -q} option if called as a script.
