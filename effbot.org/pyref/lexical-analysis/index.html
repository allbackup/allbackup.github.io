Input to the parser is a
stream of <em>tokens</em>, generated by the <em>lexical analyzer</em>.  This chapter
describes how the lexical analyzer breaks a file into tokens.</p><p>Python uses the 7-bit ASCII character set for program text.</p><p>New in version 2.3: An encoding declaration can be used to indicate
that string literals and comments use an encoding different from
ASCII. For compatibility with older versions, Python only warns if it
finds 8-bit characters; those warnings should be corrected by either
declaring an explicit encoding, or using escape sequences if those
bytes are binary data, instead of characters.</p><p>The run-time character set depends on the I/O devices connected to the
program but is generally a superset of ASCII.</p><p><strong>Future compatibility note:</strong> It may be tempting to assume that the
character set for 8-bit characters is ISO Latin-1 (an ASCII superset
that covers most western languages that use the Latin alphabet), but
it is possible that in the future Unicode text editors will become
common. These generally use the UTF-8 encoding, which is also an ASCII
superset, but with very different use for the characters with ordinals
128-255. While there is no consensus on this subject yet, it is unwise
to assume either Latin-1 or UTF-8, even though the current
implementation appears to favor Latin-1. This applies both to the
source character set and the run-time character set.</p><h2 id="line-structure">Line structure&#160;<a class="nav" href="#line-structure" title="bookmark!">#</a></h2><p>A Python program is divided into a number of <em>logical lines</em>.</p><h2 id="logical-lines">Logical lines&#160;<a class="nav" href="#logical-lines" title="bookmark!">#</a></h2><p>The end of a logical line is represented by the token
NEWLINE. Statements cannot cross logical line boundaries except where
NEWLINE is allowed by the syntax (e.g., between statements in compound
statements). A logical line is constructed from one or more <em>physical
lines</em> by following the explicit or implicit <em>line joining</em> rules.</p><h2 id="physical-lines">Physical lines&#160;<a class="nav" href="#physical-lines" title="bookmark!">#</a></h2><p>A physical line is a sequence of characters terminated by an
end-of-line sequence. In source files, any of the standard platform
line termination sequences can be used &#8212; the Unix form using ASCII LF
(linefeed), the Windows form using the ASCII sequence CR LF (return
followed by linefeed), or the Macintosh form using the ASCII CR
(return) character. All of these forms can be used equally, regardless
of platform.</p><p>When embedding Python, source code strings should be passed to Python
APIs using the standard C conventions for newline characters (the <code>\n</code>
character, representing ASCII LF, is the line terminator).</p><h2 id="comments">Comments&#160;<a class="nav" href="#comments" title="bookmark!">#</a></h2><p>A comment starts with a hash character (<code>#</code>) that is not part of a
string literal, and ends at the end of the physical line. A comment
signifies the end of the logical line unless the implicit line joining
rules are invoked. Comments are ignored by the syntax; they are not
tokens.</p><h2 id="encoding-declarations">Encoding declarations&#160;<a class="nav" href="#encoding-declarations" title="bookmark!">#</a></h2><p>If a comment in the first or second line of the Python script matches
the regular expression coding[=:]\s*([-\w.]+), this comment is
processed as an encoding declaration; the first group of this
expression names the encoding of the source code file. The recommended
forms of this expression are</p><pre class="python"><span class="pycomment"># -*- coding: &lt;encoding-name&gt; -*-</span></pre><p>which is recognized also by GNU Emacs, and</p><pre class="python"><span class="pycomment"># vim:fileencoding=&lt;encoding-name&gt;</span></pre><p>which is recognized by VIM.  In addition, if the first bytes of the
file are the UTF-8 byte-order mark (<code>'\xef\xbb\xbf'</code>), the decl
