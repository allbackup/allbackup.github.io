&lt;!-- ADSENSE --&gt;

&lt;p class='info'&gt;Updated July 14, 2003 | Fredrik Lundh&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;EffNews RSS Reader&lt;/b&gt; is a minimalist &lt;a
href="http://davenet.userland.com/2002/10/08/whatIsANewsAggregator"
title="reader, not aggregator.  not yet"&gt;RSS reader&lt;/a&gt; for
Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reader is shipped as part of &lt;a href="effbot-exe-index.htm"&gt;the
&lt;b&gt;effbot.exe&lt;/b&gt; application framework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reader is based on the &lt;a href="effnews.htm"&gt;effnews toolkit&lt;/a&gt;,
which is a freely available Python library that includes a tolerant RSS
parser and an asynchronous HTTP client module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/effbot-exe-0-9.png" alt="effnews screenshot" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"&lt;i&gt;If you love and respect very primitive and frugal things, EffNews certainly fits that profile. It's like BlogBuddy - it's for vegans, hobos and back-to-nature nuts :)&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="guide"&gt;Brief EffNews User's Guide&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(for release 1.0.5 and later; the current version is 1.0.15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;Starting the Application&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;b&gt;effbot.exe&lt;/b&gt; icon on the desktop to start the
application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is no icon on the desktop, use the explorer to
locate the &lt;b&gt;c:\effbot.exe&lt;/b&gt; directory, and run the
&lt;b&gt;effbot.exe&lt;/b&gt; binary in that directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can drag the icon to the start menu or to the process
bar.  If there is no icon, you can use the explorer to locate
the executable, and use the "send to" menu to create a desktop
shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;Viewing RSS Channels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To view an RSS channel, click on the channel name in the list to
the left.  If the channel is loaded, it should appear in the main window
within a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the arrow keys to quickly scan for new articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To view an article in your browser, double click on the article's
title or body.  Double-clicking on the channel title opens the channel's
home page, if available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, click the right button over the article panel, and select
&lt;b&gt;Open in browser&lt;/b&gt; in the context menu that appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the channel does not appear, the feed is broken or unavailable,
or uses an unknown format.  The &lt;a href="effnews.htm"&gt;effnews RSS parser&lt;/a&gt;
knows about most RSS flavours, including RSS 0.9, RSS 0.9x, RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0,
and Echo (in 1.0.10 and later).  The parser can also work around some common
problems, but may have to give up if the feed is too messed up.  In that
case, a somewhat technical error message is displayed instead of the channel
contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adding RSS Channels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add a channel, use your favourite web browser to look for nice
sites that support RSS.  Look for links to the RSS feed; this is often
&lt;a href="http://www.antipixel.com/blog/archives/2002/10/22/steal_these_buttons.html"&gt;an orange (or blue) button with the text XML (or RSS)&lt;/a&gt;, or a link that mentions &lt;b&gt;RSS&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Syndication&lt;/b&gt; or something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you've found something that might be an RSS link, use the mouse
to drag it from the browser and drop it anywhere in the effnews application
window.  If successful, the site should appear in the effnews window
after a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the effnews application window is not visible, drag the link to
the effnews item in the Windows taskbar (usually at the bottom of the
screen).  This will bring the application window to front, so you can
drop it in the window as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like what you see, click on the &lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;add&lt;/b&gt; button.  This
adds the site to the channel list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you cannot find a link, you can try dropping the URL of the home
page itself on the effnews application.  If the URL doesn't point to
RSS data, the viewer will attempt to "auto-discover" the RSS feed by
looking for
&lt;a href='http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/06/02/important_change_to_the_link_tag.html'&gt;clues&lt;/a&gt;
in the page's source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also add channels based on ordinary web pages, or other non-RSS
sources, by adding &lt;a href="effnews-provider.htm"&gt;provider plugins&lt;/a&gt; to
the application.  The application ships with a sample plugin for PythonWare's
&lt;a href="http://www.pythonware.com/daily/"&gt;Daily Python URL&lt;/a&gt; site
(to subscribe to that channel, drag that link to the application window
as usual).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;Refreshing RSS Channels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To refresh all channels, click the &lt;b&gt;refresh&lt;/b&gt; button in the lower
left corner.

&lt;p&gt;Channels that have been modified since they were last viewed are marked
with an asterisk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To refresh an individual channel, display it, click the right button over the article panel, and select &lt;b&gt;Reload&lt;/b&gt; in the context menu.  This forces &lt;b&gt;effnews&lt;/b&gt; to reload the channel even if it hasn't changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;Removing RSS Channels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remove a channel, display it as usual, click the right button over the article panel, and select &lt;b&gt;Remove channel&lt;/b&gt; in the context menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;Organizing RSS Channels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change the channel order, you can use the mouse to drag the channels
around in the channel list.

&lt;p&gt;To rename channels, shut down the application and use your favourite text
editor (!) to edit the &lt;b&gt;c:\effbot.exe\effnews.ini&lt;/b&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class='small'&gt;(yes, I know.  I'll fix this in a some post-1.0 release)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bugs"&gt;Known Issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(in release 1.0.9 and later)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modification indicator is sometimes set even if the feed hasn't
changed.  I'm investigating this, and will fix it as soon as I can figure
out why this happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use mousewheel scrolling on a feed with few entries, effnews
may display the contents twice (Fixed in 1.0.12).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's no feedback when you drag channels around in the channel
list.&lt;/p&gt;
