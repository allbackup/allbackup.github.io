library, comprising over 200 modules.  This book provides a brief
description of each module, plus one or more sample scripts showing
how to use it.  All in all, this book contains some 350 sample
scripts.</p><h2>About this Book</h2><blockquote class="epigraph"><p><i>&#8220;Those people who have nothing better to do than post
on the Internet all day long are rarely the ones who have the most
insights&#8221;</i></p><i>Jacob Nielsen, December 1998</i></blockquote><p>Since I first stumbled upon Python some five years ago, I&#8217;ve
spent hundreds of hours answering questions on the
<b>comp.lang.python</b> newsgroup. Maybe someone found a module
that might be exactly what they want, but they couldn&#8217;t really
figure out how to use it. Maybe someone had picked the wrong module
for the task. Or maybe someone tried to reinvent the wheel. Often,
a short sample script could be much more helpful than a pointer to
the reference documentation.</p><p>And if you post a couple of scripts each week, for a number of
years, you&#8217;ll end up with a rather large collection of potentially
useful scripts. What you&#8217;ll find in this book are the best parts
from over 3,000 newsgroup messages. You&#8217;ll also find hundreds of
new scripts added to make sure every little nook and cranny of
standard library has been fully covered.</p><p>I&#8217;ve worked hard to make the scripts easy to understand and
adaptable. I&#8217;ve intentionally kept the annotations as short as
possible. If you want more background, there&#8217;s plenty of reference
material shipped with most Python distributions. In this book, the
emphasis is on the code.</p><p>Comments, suggestions, and bug reports are welcome. Send them to

arrives, but it might take a while until I get around to
answer.</p><p>For updates, addenda, and other information related to this

(optional) Tkinter user interface library. There are several
reasons for this, mostly related to time, space, and the fact that
I&#8217;m working on several other Tkinter documentation projects.</p><p>For current status on these projects, see <s>http://www.pythonware.com/people/fredrik/tkinterbook.htm</s>.</p><h3 style="sect2">Production details</h3><p>This book was written in DocBook SGML. I used a variety of
tools, including Secret Labs&#8217; PythonWorks, and Excosoft Documentor,
James Clark&#8217;s Jade DSSSL processor, and Norm Walsh&#8217;s DocBook
stylesheets. And a bunch of Python scripts, of course.</p><p>Thanks to my referees: Tim Peters, Guido van Rossum, David
Ascher, Mark Lutz, and Rael Dornfest, and the PythonWare crew:
Matthew Ellis, H&#229;kan Karlsson, and Rune Uhlin.</p><h2>About the Examples</h2><p>Unless otherwise noted, all examples run under Python 1.5.2 and
Python 2.0. I&#8217;ve tried not to depend on internal details, and I
expect most scripts to work with upcoming 2.X versions as well.</p><p>The examples have been tested on Windows, Solaris, and Linux.
Except for a few scripts that depend on platform specific modules,
the examples should work right out of the box on most other
platforms as well.</p><p>(If you find something that doesn&#8217;t work as expected, let me
know!)</p><p>All code is <a href="/zone/copyright.htm">copyrighted</a>, but
you are of course free to use one or more modules in your own programs.
Just don&#8217;t forget where you got them.</p><p>Most script files are named after the module they&#8217;re using,
followed by the string <span>&#8220;<b>-example-</b>&#8221;</span> and a
unique <span>&#8220;serial number&#8221;</span>. Note that the scripts
sometimes appear out of order; it&#8217;s done this way on purpose, to
match the filenames used in an earlier version of this book,
