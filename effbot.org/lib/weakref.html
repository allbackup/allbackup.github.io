<p>The <code>weakref</code> module
allows the Python programmer to create weak references to
objects.</p>

<p>In the following, the term referent means the object which is
referred to by a weak reference.</p>

<p>A weak reference to an object is not enough to keep the object
alive: when the only remaining references to a referent are weak
references, garbage collection is free to destroy the referent and
reuse its memory for something else. A primary use for weak
references is to implement caches or mappings holding large
objects, where it's desired that a large object not be kept alive
solely because it appears in a cache or mapping. For example, if
you have a number of large binary image objects, you may wish to
associate a name with each. If you used a Python dictionary to map
names to images, or images to names, the image objects would remain
alive just because they appeared as values or keys in the
dictionaries. The <a class="link" href="#WeakKeyDictionary"><code>
WeakKeyDictionary</code></a> and <a class="link" href="#WeakValueDictionary"><code>WeakValueDictionary</code></a> classes
supplied by the <code>weakref</code>
module are an alternative, using weak references to construct
mappings that don't keep objects alive solely because they appear
in the mapping objects. If, for example, an image object is a value
in a <a class="link" href="#WeakValueDictionary"><code>
WeakValueDictionary</code></a>, then when the last remaining references to
that image object are the weak references held by weak mappings,
garbage collection can reclaim the object, and its corresponding
entries in weak mappings are simply deleted.</p>

<p><a class="link" href="#WeakKeyDictionary"><code>
WeakKeyDictionary</code></a> and <a class="link" href="#WeakValueDictionary"><code>WeakValueDictionary</code></a> use weak
references in their implementation, setting up callback functions
on the weak references that notify the weak dictionaries when a key
or value has been reclaimed by garbage collection. Most programs
should find that using one of these weak dictionary types is all
they need - it's not usually necessary to create your own weak
references directly. The low-level machinery used by the weak
dictionary implementations is exposed by the <code>weakref</code> module for the benefit of advanced
uses.</p>

<p>Not all objects can be weakly referenced; those objects which
can include class instances, functions written in Python (but not
in C), methods (both bound and unbound), sets, frozensets, file
objects, generators, type objects, DBcursor objects from the <code>bsddb</code> module, sockets, arrays,
deques, and regular expression pattern objects. Changed in version
2.4: Added support for files, sockets, arrays, and patterns.</p>

<p>Several builtin types such as <code>
list</code> and <code>dict</code> do not
directly support weak references but can add support through
subclassing:</p>

<pre>
class Dict(dict):
    pass

obj = Dict(red=1, green=2, blue=3)   # this object is weak referencable
</pre>

<p>Extension types can easily be made to support weak references;
see section <code>
weakref-extension.html#weakref-extension</code>, &#8220;Weak
References in Extension Types,&#8221; for more information.</p>

<dd class="class">
<p>Return a weak reference to <var>object</var>. The original
object can be retrieved by calling the reference object if the
referent is still alive; if the referent is no longer alive,
calling the reference object will cause <code>None</code> to be
returned. If <var>callback</var> is provided and not <code>
None</code>, it will be called when the object is about to be
finalized; the weak reference object will be passed as the only
parameter to the callback; the referent will no longer be
available.</p>

<p>It is allowable for many weak references to be constructed for
the same object. Callbacks registered for each weak reference will
be called from the most recently registered callback to the oldest
registered callback.</p>

<p>Exceptions raised by the callback will be noted on the standard
error output, but cannot be propagated; they are handled in exactly
the same way as exceptions raised from an object's <code>__del__</code> method.</p>

<p>Weak references are hashable if the <var>object</var> is
hashable. They will maintain their hash value even after the <var>
object</var> was deleted. If <code>
hash</code> is called the first time only after the <var>object</var>
was deleted, the call will raise <code>exceptions.TypeError</code>.</p>

<p>Weak references support tests for equality, but not ordering. If
the referents are still alive, two references have the same
equality relationship as their referents (regardless of the <var>
callback</var>). If either referent has been deleted, the
references are equal only if the reference objects are the same
object.</p>

<blockquote><span class="mark">@since</span> Changed in version
2.4: This is now a subclassable type rather than a factory
function; it derives from object.<br />

References</a> The proposal and rationale for this feature,
including links to earlier implementations and information about
similar features in other languages. 

<h2 id="weak-reference-objects">Weak Reference Objects <a class="nav" href="#weak-reference-objects">#</a></h2>

<p>Weak reference objects have no attributes or methods, but do
allow the referent to be obtained, if it still exists, by calling
it:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; import weakref
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Object:
...     pass
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; o = Object()
&gt;&gt;&gt; r = weakref.ref(o)
&gt;&gt;&gt; o2 = r()
&gt;&gt;&gt; o is o2
True
</pre>

<p>If the referent no longer exists, calling the reference object
returns <code>None</code>:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; del o, o2
&gt;&gt;&gt; print r()
None
</pre>

<p>Testing that a weak reference object is still live should be
done using the expression <var>ref</var>() is not None. Normally,
application code that needs to use a reference object should follow
this pattern:</p>

<pre>
# r is a weak reference object
o = r()
if o is None:
    # referent has been garbage collected
    print "Object has been deallocated; can't frobnicate."
else:
    print "Object is still live!"
    o.do_something_useful()
</pre>

<p>Using a separate test for &#8220;liveness&#8221; creates race
conditions in threaded applications; another thread can cause a
weak reference to become invalidated before the weak reference is
called; the idiom shown above is safe in threaded applications as
well as single-threaded applications.</p>

<p>Specialized versions of <a class="link" href="#ref"><code>ref</code></a>
objects can be created through subclassing. This is used in the
implementation of the <a class="link" href="#WeakValueDictionary"><code>WeakValueDictionary</code></a> to reduce
the memory overhead for each entry in the mapping. This may be most
useful to associate additional information with a reference, but
could also be used to insert additional processing on calls to
retrieve the referent.</p>

<p>This example shows how a subclass of <a class="link" href="#ref"><code>ref</code></a> can be used to store additional information
about an object and affect the value that's returned when the
referent is accessed:</p>

<pre>
import weakref

class ExtendedRef(weakref.ref):
    def __init__(self, ob, callback=None, **annotations):
        super(ExtendedRef, self).__init__(ob, callback)
        self.__counter = 0
        for k, v in annotations.iteritems():
            setattr(self, k, v)

    def __call__(self):
        """Return a pair containing the referent and the number of
        times the reference has been called.
        """
        ob = super(ExtendedRef, self).__call__()
        if ob is not None:
            self.__counter += 1
            ob = (ob, self.__counter)
        return ob
</pre>

<h2 id="example">Example <a class="nav" href="#example">#</a></h2>

<p>This simple example shows how an application can use objects IDs
to retrieve objects that it has seen before. The IDs of the objects
can then be used in other data structures without forcing the
objects to remain alive, but the objects can still be retrieved by
ID if they do.</p>

<pre>
import weakref

_id2obj_dict = weakref.WeakValueDictionary()

def remember(obj):
    oid = id(obj)
    _id2obj_dict[oid] = obj
    return oid

def id2obj(oid):
    return _id2obj_dict[oid]
</pre>

<h2 id="weak-references-in-extension-types">Weak References in Extension Types <a class="nav" href="#weak-references-in-extension-types">#</a></h2>

<p>One of the goals of the implementation is to allow any type to
participate in the weak reference mechanism without incurring the
overhead on those objects which do not benefit by weak referencing
(such as numbers).</p>

<p>For an object to be weakly referencable, the extension must
include a <code>c:PyObject*</code>
field in the instance structure for the use of the weak reference
mechanism; it must be initialized to <code>NULL</code> by the
object's constructor. It must also set the <code>tp_weaklistoffset</code> field of the
corresponding type object to the offset of the field. Also, it
needs to add <code>Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_WEAKREFS</code> to the tp_flags
slot. For example, the instance type is defined with the following
structure:</p>

<pre>
typedef struct {
    PyObject_HEAD
    PyClassObject *in_class;       /* The class object */
    PyObject      *in_dict;        /* A dictionary */
    PyObject      *in_weakreflist; /* List of weak references */
} PyInstanceObject;
</pre>

<p>The statically-declared type object for instances is defined
this way:</p>

<pre>
PyTypeObject PyInstance_Type = {
    PyObject_HEAD_INIT(&amp;PyType_Type)
    0,
    "module.instance",

    /* Lots of stuff omitted for brevity... */

    Py_TPFLAGS_DEFAULT | Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_WEAKREFS   /* tp_flags */
    0,                                          /* tp_doc */
    0,                                          /* tp_traverse */
    0,                                          /* tp_clear */
    0,                                          /* tp_richcompare */
    offsetof(PyInstanceObject, in_weakreflist), /* tp_weaklistoffset */
};
</pre>

<p>The type constructor is responsible for initializing the weak
reference list to <code>NULL</code>:</p>

<pre>
static PyObject *
instance_new() {
    /* Other initialization stuff omitted for brevity */

    self-&gt;in_weakreflist = NULL;

    return (PyObject *) self;
}
</pre>

<p>The only further addition is that the destructor needs to call
the weak reference manager to clear any weak references. This
should be done before any other parts of the destruction have
occurred, but is only required if the weak reference list is
non-<code>NULL</code>:</p>

<pre>
static void
instance_dealloc(PyInstanceObject *inst)
{
    /* Allocate temporaries if needed, but do not begin
       destruction just yet.
     */

    if (inst-&gt;in_weakreflist != NULL)
        PyObject_ClearWeakRefs((PyObject *) inst);

    /* Proceed with object destruction normally. */
}
</pre>
</div>
</div></body></html>
