<h1>heapq&#8212;Heap queue algorithm</h1>

<div class="toc"><dl><dt>On this page:</dt><dd><a href="#theory">Theory</a></dd></dl></div><p>New in version 2.3.</p>

<p>This module provides an implementation of the heap queue
algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm.</p>

<p>Heaps are arrays for which <var>heap</var>[<var>k</var>] &lt;=
<var>heap</var>[2*<var>k</var>+1] and <var>heap</var>[<var>k</var>]
&lt;= <var>heap</var>[2*<var>k</var>+2] for all <var>k</var>,
counting elements from zero. For the sake of comparison,
non-existing elements are considered to be infinite. The
interesting property of a heap is that <var>heap</var>[0] is always
its smallest element.</p>

<p>The API below differs from textbook heap algorithms in two
aspects: (a) We use zero-based indexing. This makes the
relationship between the index for a node and the indexes for its
children slightly less obvious, but is more suitable since Python
uses zero-based indexing. (b) Our pop method returns the smallest
item, not the largest (called a "min heap" in textbooks; a "max
heap" is more common in texts because of its suitability for
in-place sorting).</p>

<p>These two make it possible to view the heap as a regular Python
list without surprises: <var>heap</var>[0] is the smallest item,
and <var>heap</var>.sort() maintains the heap invariant!</p>

<p>To create a heap, use a list initialized to <code>[]</code>, or
you can transform a populated list into a heap via function <a class="link" href="#heapify"><code>heapify</code></a>.</p>

<p>The following functions are provided:</p>
</div>
<dl><dt class="function" id="heappush"><b>heappush(heap, item)</b> <tt class="nav"><a class="nav" href="heapq.heappush" title="bookmark">#</a>|<a class="nav" href="#" title="edit/suggest changes">!</a>|<a class="nav" href="#" title="search for related examples">&amp;</a></tt></dt>

<dd class="function">
<p>Push the value <var>item</var> onto the <var>heap</var>,
maintaining the heap invariant.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="function" id="heappop"><b>heappop(heap)</b> <tt class="nav"><a class="nav" href="heapq.heappop" title="bookmark">#</a>|<a class="nav" href="#" title="edit/suggest changes">!</a>|<a class="nav" href="#" title="search for related examples">&amp;</a></tt></dt>

<dd class="function">
<p>Pop and return the smallest item from the <var>heap</var>,
maintaining the heap invariant. If the heap is empty, <code>
exceptions.IndexError</code> is raised.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="function" id="heapify"><b>heapify(x)</b> <tt class="nav"><a class="nav" href="heapq.heapify" title="bookmark">#</a>|<a class="nav" href="#" title="edit/suggest changes">!</a>|<a class="nav" href="#" title="search for related examples">&amp;</a></tt></dt>

<dd class="function">
<p>Transform list <var>x</var> into a heap, in-place, in linear
time.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="function" id="heapreplace"><b>heapreplace(heap, item)</b> <tt class="nav"><a class="nav" href="heapq.heapreplace" title="bookmark">#</a>|<a class="nav" href="#" title="edit/suggest changes">!</a>|<a class="nav" href="#" title="search for related examples">&amp;</a></tt></dt>

<dd class="function">
<p>Pop and return the smallest item from the <var>heap</var>, and
also push the new <var>item</var>. The heap size doesn't change. If
the heap is empty, <code>exceptions.IndexError</code> is
raised. This is more efficient than <a class="link" href="#heappop"><code>heappop</code></a> followed by <a class="link" href="#heappush"><code>heappush</code></a>, and can be more appropriate when
using a fixed-size heap. Note that the value returned may be larger
than <var>item</var>! That constrains reasonable uses of this
routine unless written as part of a conditional replacement:</p>

<pre>
        if item &gt; heap[0]:
            item = heapreplace(heap, item)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl><div class="text">
<p>Example of use:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from heapq import heappush, heappop
&gt;&gt;&gt; heap = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; data = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in data:
...     heappush(heap, item)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; while heap:
...     sorted.append(heappop(heap))
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; print sorted
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
&gt;&gt;&gt; data.sort()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print data == sorted
True
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

<p>The module also offers two general purpose functions based on
heaps.</p>
</div>
<dl><dt class="function" id="nlargest"><b>nlargest(n, iterable)</b> <tt class="nav"><a class="nav" href="heapq.nlargest" title="bookmark">#</a>|<a class="nav" href="#" title="edit/suggest changes">!</a>|<a class="nav" href="#" title="search for related examples">&amp;</a></tt></dt>

<dd class="function">
<p>Return a list with the <var>n</var> largest elements from the
dataset defined by <var>iterable</var>. Equivalent to: <code>
sorted(iterable, reverse=True)[:n]</code></p>

2.4.<br />

</dd>
<dt class="function" id="nsmallest"><b>nsmallest(n, iterable)</b> <tt class="nav"><a class="nav" href="heapq.nsmallest" title="bookmark">#</a>|<a class="nav" href="#" title="edit/suggest changes">!</a>|<a class="nav" href="#" title="search for related examples">&amp;</a></tt></dt>

<dd class="function">

</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl><div class="text">
<p>Both functions perform best for smaller values of <var>n</var>.
For larger values, it is more efficient to use the <code>sorted</code> function. Also, when <code>
n==1</code>, it is more efficient to use the builtin <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> functions.</p>

<h2 id="theory">Theory <a class="nav" href="#theory">#</a></h2>

<p>(This explanation is due to Fran&#231;ois Pinard. The Python
code for this module was contributed by Kevin O'Connor.)</p>

<p>Heaps are arrays for which <code>a[</code><var>k</var>] &lt;=
a[2*<var>k</var>+1] and <code>a[</code><var>k</var>] &lt;=
a[2*<var>k</var>+2] for all <var>k</var>, counting elements from 0.
For the sake of comparison, non-existing elements are considered to
be infinite. The interesting property of a heap is that <code>
a[0]</code> is always its smallest element.</p>

<p>The strange invariant above is meant to be an efficient memory
representation for a tournament. The numbers below are <var>
k</var>, not <code>a[</code><var>k</var>]:</p>

<pre>
                                   0

                  1                                 2

          3               4                5               6

      7       8       9       10      11      12      13      14

    15 16   17 18   19 20   21 22   23 24   25 26   27 28   29 30
</pre>

<p>In the tree above, each cell <var>k</var> is topping <code>
2*</code><var>k</var>+1 and <code>2*</code><var>k</var>+2. In an
usual binary tournament we see in sports, each cell is the winner
over the two cells it tops, and we can trace the winner down the
tree to see all opponents s/he had. However, in many computer
applications of such tournaments, we do not need to trace the
history of a winner. To be more memory efficient, when a winner is
promoted, we try to replace it by something else at a lower level,
and the rule becomes that a cell and the two cells it tops contain
three different items, but the top cell "wins" over the two topped
cells.</p>

<p>If this heap invariant is protected at all time, index 0 is
clearly the overall winner. The simplest algorithmic way to remove
it and find the "next" winner is to move some loser (let's say cell
30 in the diagram above) into the 0 position, and then percolate
this new 0 down the tree, exchanging values, until the invariant is
re-established. This is clearly logarithmic on the total number of
items in the tree. By iterating over all items, you get an O(n log
n) sort.</p>

<p>A nice feature of this sort is that you can efficiently insert
new items while the sort is going on, provided that the inserted
items are not "better" than the last 0'th element you extracted.
This is especially useful in simulation contexts, where the tree
holds all incoming events, and the "win" condition means the
smallest scheduled time. When an event schedule other events for
execution, they are scheduled into the future, so they can easily
go into the heap. So, a heap is a good structure for implementing
schedulers (this is what I used for my MIDI sequencer :-).</p>

<p>Various structures for implementing schedulers have been
extensively studied, and heaps are good for this, as they are
reasonably speedy, the speed is almost constant, and the worst case
is not much different than the average case. However, there are
other representations which are more efficient overall, yet the
worst cases might be terrible.</p>

<p>Heaps are also very useful in big disk sorts. You most probably
all know that a big sort implies producing "runs" (which are
pre-sorted sequences, which size is usually related to the amount
of CPU memory), followed by a merging passes for these runs, which
merging is often very cleverly organised<code>footnote:21725</code>. It is very important
that the initial sort produces the longest runs possible.
Tournaments are a good way to that. If, using all the memory
available to hold a tournament, you replace and percolate items
that happen to fit the current run, you'll produce runs which are
twice the size of the memory for random input, and much better for
input fuzzily ordered.</p>

<p>Moreover, if you output the 0'th item on disk and get an input
which may not fit in the current tournament (because the value
"wins" over the last output value), it cannot fit in the heap, so
the size of the heap decreases. The freed memory could be cleverly
reused immediately for progressively building a second heap, which
grows at exactly the same rate the first heap is melting. When the
first heap completely vanishes, you switch heaps and start a new
run. Clever and quite effective!</p>

<p>In a word, heaps are useful memory structures to know. I use
them in a few applications, and I think it is good to keep a `heap'
module around. :-)</p>

<p>The disk balancing algorithms which are current, nowadays, are
more annoying than clever, and this is a consequence of the seeking
capabilities of the disks. On devices which cannot seek, like big
tape drives, the story was quite different, and one had to be very
clever to ensure (far in advance) that each tape movement will be
the most effective possible (that is, will best participate at
"progressing" the merge). Some tapes were even able to read
backwards, and this was also used to avoid the rewinding time.
Believe me, real good tape sorts were quite spectacular to watch!
From all times, sorting has always been a Great Art! :-)</p>
