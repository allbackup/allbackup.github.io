Python code; consider rewriting parts in C as a last resort.</p><p>In some cases it&#8217;s possible to automatically translate Python to C or
x86 assembly language, meaning that you don&#8217;t have to modify your code
to gain increased speed.</p><p><a href="http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/">Pyrex</a> can compile a slightly modified version of Python code into
a C extension, and can be used on many different platforms.</p><p><a href="http://psyco.sourceforge.net">Psyco</a> is a just-in-time compiler that translates Python code into
x86 machine code.  If you can use it, Psyco can provide dramatic
speedups for critical functions.</p><p>The rest of this answer will discuss various tricks for squeezing a
bit more speed out of Python code.  <em>Never</em> apply any optimization
tricks unless you know you need them, after profiling has indicated
that a particular function is the heavily executed hot spot in the
code.  Optimizations almost always make the code less clear, and you
shouldn&#8217;t pay the costs of reduced clarity (increased development
time, greater likelihood of bugs) unless the resulting performance
benefit is worth it.</p><p>There is a page on the wiki devoted to <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips">performance tips</a>.</p><p>Guido van Rossum has written up an anecdote related to optimization at
<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/list2str.html">http://www.python.org/doc/essays/list2str.html</a>.</p><p>One thing to notice is that function and (especially) method calls are
rather expensive; if you have designed a purely OO interface with lots
of tiny functions that don&#8217;t do much more than get or set an instance
variable or call another method, you might consider using a more
direct way such as directly accessing instance variables.  Also see
the standard module <a href="/pyref/profile.htm"><strong>profile</strong></a> which makes it possible to find
out where your program is spending most of its time (if you have some
patience &#8212; the profiling itself can slow your program down by an
order of magnitude).</p><p>Remember that many standard optimization heuristics you may know from
other programming experience may well apply to Python.  For example it
may be faster to send output to output devices using larger writes
rather than smaller ones in order to reduce the overhead of kernel
system calls.  Thus CGI scripts that write all output in &#8220;one shot&#8221;
may be faster than those that write lots of small pieces of output.</p><p>Also, be sure to use Python&#8217;s core features where appropriate.  For
example, slicing allows programs to chop up lists and other sequence
objects in a single tick of the interpreter&#8217;s mainloop using highly
optimized C implementations.  Thus to get the same effect as:</p><pre class=
