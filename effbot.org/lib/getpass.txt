<h1>getpass&#8212;Portable password input</h1>

<p>The {@link getpass} module provides two functions:

@@function getpass([prompt])

<p>Prompt the user for a password without echoing. The user is prompted
using the string {@var prompt}, which defaults to {@code 'Password: '}.
Availability: Macintosh, Unix, Windows.

@@function getuser()

<p>Return the &#8220;login name&#8221; of the user. Availability: Unix,
Windows.

<p>This function checks the environment variables LOGNAME, USER, LNAME
and USERNAME, in order, and returns the value of the first one which is
set to a non-empty string. If none are set, the login name from the
password database is returned on systems which support the {@link pwd}
module, otherwise, an exception is raised.
