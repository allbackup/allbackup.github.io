<em><a href="http://www.unicom.com/pw/reply-to-harmful.html">&#8220;Reply-To&#8221; Munging Considered Harmful</a></em>
for some background.</p><p>Also see this explanation from Danny Yoo:</p><blockquote><p>Let us take a hypothetical situation.  Let&#8217;s say that there are two
  people, say person J and person D.  And say that D wrote a slightly
  unfriendly reply on Tutor that didn&#8217;t sit well, and person J rightfully
  responded back and wondered why D was so curt.</p><p>It might be embarassing if the mailing list default was to have J&#8217;s reply
  go directly to the Tutor list rather than to just D.  Again, it might not,
  but who knows?  If Reply-to munging was turned on by default, it would
  make such a mistake very likely.</p><p>(And in the end, D might want to apologize to J; D was having a very busy
  day today.  And it might be embarassing to have that automatically posted
  on Tutor too.  Who knows?)</p><p>We want to allow people to have the opportunity to easily respond in
  private, particularly for cases like this.</p><p>All of this is purely hypothetical, of course.</p><p>From: <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/tutor/2005-July/039889.html">http://mail.python.org/pipermail/tutor/2005-July/039889.html</a></p></blockquote><p>CATEGORY: tutor</p></div><div class="yui-u">&#160;</div></div><div class="yui-g"></div></div></div></div><div class="yui-b"><div id='menu'><ul><li><b><a href="/" title="Go to effbot.org.">::: effbot.org</a></b></li><li><b><a href="." title="Go to pyfaq index page.">::: pyfaq :::</a></b></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="ft"><p><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/"><img src="/media/img/djangosite80x15.gif" border="0" alt="A Django site." title="A Django site." style="vertical-align: bottom;" width="80" height="15" ></a>
