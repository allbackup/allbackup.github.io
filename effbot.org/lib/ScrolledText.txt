<h1>ScrolledText&#8212;Scrolled Text Widget</h1>

<p>Availability: Tk.

<p>The {@link ScrolledText} module provides a class of the same name
which implements a basic text widget which has a vertical scroll bar
configured to do the &#8220;right thing.&#8221; Using the {@link
ScrolledText} class is a lot easier than setting up a text widget and
scroll bar directly. The constructor is the same as that of the {@link
Tkinter.Text} class.

<p>The text widget and scrollbar are packed together in a {@link Frame},
and the methods of the {@link Grid} and {@link Pack} geometry managers
are acquired from the {@link Frame} object. This allows the {@link
ScrolledText} widget to be used directly to achieve most normal geometry
management behavior.

<p>Should more specific control be necessary, the following attributes
are available:

@@attribute frame

<p>The frame which surrounds the text and scroll bar widgets.

@@attribute vbar

<p>The scroll bar widget.
