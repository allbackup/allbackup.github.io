value calculated from the key value to find the key. If the key were a
mutable object, its value could change, and thus its hash could also
change. But since whoever changes the key object can&#8217;t tell that it
was being used as a dictionary key, it can&#8217;t move the entry around in
the dictionary. Then, when you try to look up the same object in the
dictionary it won&#8217;t be found because its hash value is different. If
you tried to look up the old value it wouldn&#8217;t be found either,
because the value of the object found in that hash bin would be
different.</p><p>If you want a dictionary indexed with a list, simply convert the list
to a tuple first; the function <a href="/pyref/tuple.htm"><strong>tuple(L)</strong></a> creates a
tuple with the same entries as the list L. Tuples are immutable and
can therefore be used as dictionary keys.</p><p>Some ideas for alternative implementations have been proposed:</p><p><strong>Hash lists by their address (object ID).</strong> This doesn&#8217;t work because
if you construct a new list with the same value it won&#8217;t be found;
e.g.:</p><pre class="python">d = {[1,2]: <span class="pystring">'12'</span>}
<span class="pykeyword">print</span> d[ [1,2] ]</pre><p>would raise a <a href="/pyref/KeyError.htm"><strong>KeyError</strong></a> exception because the <a href="/pyref/id.htm"><strong>id</strong></a> of the
[1,2] used in the second line differs from that in the first line. In other
words, dictionary keys should be compared usin
