<h1>linecache&#8212;Random access to text lines</h1>

<p>The {@link linecache} module allows one to get any line from any
file, while attempting to optimize internally, using a cache, the common
case where many lines are read from a single file. This is used by the
{@link traceback} module to retrieve source lines for inclusion in the
formatted traceback.

<p>The {@link linecache} module defines the following functions:

@@function getline(filename, lineno)

<p>Get line {@var lineno} from file named {@var filename}. This function
will never throw an exception -- it will return {@code &#8221;} on
errors (the terminating newline character will be included for lines
that are found).

<p>If a file named {@var filename} is not found, the function will look
for it in the module search path, {@code sys.path}.

@@function clearcache()

<p>Clear the cache. Use this function if you no longer need lines from
files previously read using {@link getline}.

@@function checkcache([filename])

<p>Check the cache for validity. Use this function if files in the cache
may have changed on disk, and you require the updated version. If {@var
filename} is omitted, it will check the whole cache entries.

<p>Example:

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; import linecache
&gt;&gt;&gt; linecache.getline('/etc/passwd', 4)
'sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/bin/sh\n'
</pre>
