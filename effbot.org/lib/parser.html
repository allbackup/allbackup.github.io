provides an interface to Python's internal parser and byte-code
compiler. The primary purpose for this interface is to allow Python
code to edit the parse tree of a Python expression and create
executable code from this. This is better than trying to parse and
modify an arbitrary Python code fragment as a string because
parsing is performed in a manner identical to the code forming the
application. It is also faster.</p>

<p>There are a few things to note about this module which are
important to making use of the data structures created. This is not
a tutorial on editing the parse trees for Python code, but some
examples of using the <code>parser</code>
module are presented.</p>

<p>Most importantly, a good understanding of the Python grammar
processed by the internal parser is required. For full information
on the language syntax, refer to the <code>Python Language Reference</code>. The
parser itself is created from a grammar specification defined in
the file Grammar/Grammar in the standard Python distribution. The
parse trees stored in the AST objects created by this module are
the actual output from the internal parser when created by the <a class="link" href="#expr"><code>expr</code></a> or <a class="link" href="#suite"><code>suite</code></a> functions, described below. The AST
objects created by <a class="link" href="#sequence2ast"><code>
sequence2ast</code></a> faithfully simulate those structures. Be aware
that the values of the sequences which are considered
&#8220;correct&#8221; will vary from one version of Python to
another as the formal grammar for the language is revised. However,
transporting code from one Python version to another as source text
will always allow correct parse trees to be created in the target
version, with the only restriction being that migrating to an older
version of the interpreter will not support more recent language
constructs. The parse trees are not typically compatible from one
version to another, whereas source code has always been
forward-compatible.</p>

<p>Each element of the sequences returned by <a class="link" href="#ast2list"><code>ast2list</code></a> or <a class="link" href="#ast2tuple"><code>ast2tuple</code></a> has a simple form. Sequences
representing non-terminal elements in the grammar always have a
length greater than one. The first element is an integer which
identifies a production in the grammar. These integers are given
symbolic names in the C header file Include/graminit.h and the
Python module <code>symbol</code>. Each
additional element of the sequence represents a component of the
production as recognized in the input string: these are always
sequences which have the same form as the parent. An important
aspect of this structure which should be noted is that keywords
used to identify the parent node type, such as the keyword <code>if</code> in an <code>if_stmt</code>, are
included in the node tree without any special treatment. For
example, the <code>if</code> keyword is
represented by the tuple <code>(1, 'if')</code>, where <code>
1</code> is the numeric value associated with all <code>NAME</code>
tokens, including variable and function names defined by the user.
In an alternate form returned when line number information is
requested, the same token might be represented as <code>(1, 'if',
12)</code>, where the <code>12</code> represents the line number at
which the terminal symbol was found.</p>

<p>Terminal elements are represented in much the same way, but
without any child elements and the addition of the source text
which was identified. The example of the <code>if</code> keyword above is representative. The various
types of terminal symbols are defined in the C header file
Include/token.h and the Python module <code>token</code>.</p>

<p>The AST objects are not required to support the functionality of
this module, but are provided for three purposes: to allow an
application to amortize the cost of processing complex parse trees,
to provide a parse tree representation which conserves memory space
when compared to the Python list or tuple representation, and to
ease the creation of additional modules in C which manipulate parse
trees. A simple &#8220;wrapper&#8221; class may be created in
Python to hide the use of AST objects.</p>

<p>The <code>parser</code> module defines
functions for a few distinct purposes. The most important purposes
are to create AST objects and to convert AST objects to other
representations such as parse trees and compiled code objects, but
there are also functions which serve to query the type of parse
tree represented by an AST object. <span class="mark">@see</span>
<code>Module symbol</code> Useful
constants representing internal nodes of the parse tree. <span class="mark">@see</span> <code>Module
token</code> Useful constants representing leaf nodes of the parse
tree and functions for testing node values.</p>

<p>The parser modules allows operations to be performed on the
parse tree of Python source code before the bytecode is generated,
and provides for inspection of the parse tree for information
gathering purposes. Two examples are presented. The simple example
demonstrates emulation of the <code>
compile</code> built-in function and the complex example shows the use
of a parse tree for information discovery.</p>
</div>
<div class="error">
<h3>Emulation of compile()</h3>

<p>While many useful operations may take place between parsing and
bytecode generation, the simplest operation is to do nothing. For
this purpose, using the <code>
parser</code> module to produce an intermediate data structure is
equivalent to the code</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; code = compile('a + 5', 'file.py', 'eval')
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; eval(code)
10
</pre>

<p>The equivalent operation using the <code>parser</code> module is somewhat longer, and allows
the intermediate internal parse tree to be retained as an AST
object:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; import parser
&gt;&gt;&gt; ast = parser.expr('a + 5')
&gt;&gt;&gt; code = ast.compile('file.py')
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; eval(code)
10
</pre>

<p>An application which needs both AST and code objects can package
this code into readily available functions:</p>

<pre>
import parser

def load_suite(source_string):
    ast = parser.suite(source_string)
    return ast, ast.compile()

def load_expression(source_string):
    ast = parser.expr(source_string)
    return ast, ast.compile()
</pre>

<h3>Information Discovery</h3>

<p>Some applications benefit from direct access to the parse tree.
The remainder of this section demonstrates how the parse tree
provides access to module documentation defined in docstrings
without requiring that the code being examined be loaded into a
running interpreter via <code>
import</code>. This can be very useful for performing analyses of
untrusted code.</p>

<p>Generally, the example will demonstrate how the parse tree may
be traversed to distill interesting information. Two functions and
a set of classes are developed which provide programmatic access to
high level function and class definitions provided by a module. The
classes extract information from the parse tree and provide access
to the information at a useful semantic level, one function
provides a simple low-level pattern matching capability, and the
other function defines a high-level interface to the classes by
handling file operations on behalf of the caller. All source files
mentioned here which are not part of the Python installation are
located in the Demo/parser/ directory of the distribution.</p>

<p>The dynamic nature of Python allows the programmer a great deal
of flexibility, but most modules need only a limited measure of
this when defining classes, functions, and methods. In this
example, the only definitions that will be considered are those
which are defined in the top level of their context, e.g., a
function defined by a <code>def</code>
statement at column zero of a module, but not a function defined
within a branch of an <code>if</code> ... <code>else</code> construct, though there are
some good reasons for doing so in some situations. Nesting of
definitions will be handled by the code developed in the
example.</p>

<p>To construct the upper-level extraction methods, we need to know
what the parse tree structure looks like and how much of it we
actually need to be concerned about. Python uses a moderately deep
parse tree so there are a large number of intermediate nodes. It is
important to read and understand the formal grammar used by Python.
This is specified in the file Grammar/Grammar in the distribution.
Consider the simplest case of interest when searching for
docstrings: a module consisting of a docstring and nothing else.
(See file docstring.py.)</p>

<pre>
"""Some documentation.
"""
</pre>

<p>Using the interpreter to take a look at the parse tree, we find
a bewildering mass of numbers and parentheses, with the
documentation buried deep in nested tuples.</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; import parser
&gt;&gt;&gt; import pprint
&gt;&gt;&gt; ast = parser.suite(open('docstring.py').read())
&gt;&gt;&gt; tup = ast.totuple()
&gt;&gt;&gt; pprint.pprint(tup)
(257,
 (264,
  (265,
   (266,
    (267,
     (307,
      (287,
       (288,
        (289,
         (290,
          (292,
           (293,
            (294,
             (295,
              (296,
               (297,
                (298,
                 (299,
                  (300, (3, '"""Some documentation.\n"""'))))))))))))))))),
   (4, ''))),
 (4, ''),
 (0, ''))
</pre>

<p>The numbers at the first element of each node in the tree are
the node types; they map directly to terminal and non-terminal
symbols in the grammar. Unfortunately, they are represented as
integers in the internal representation, and the Python structures
generated do not change that. However, the <code>symbol</code> and <code>token</code> modules provide symbolic names for the
node types and dictionaries which map from the integers to the
symbolic names for the node types.</p>

<p>In the output presented above, the outermost tuple contains four
elements: the integer <code>257</code> and three additional tuples.
Node type <code>257</code> has the symbolic name <code>
file_input</code>. Each of these inner tuples contains an integer
as the first element; these integers, <code>264</code>, <code>
4</code>, and <code>0</code>, represent the node types <code>
stmt</code>, <code>NEWLINE</code>, and <code>ENDMARKER</code>,
respectively. Note that these values may change depending on the
version of Python you are using; consult symbol.py and token.py for
details of the mapping. It should be fairly clear that the
outermost node is related primarily to the input source rather than
the contents of the file, and may be disregarded for the moment.
The <code>stmt</code> node is much more interesting. In particular,
all docstrings are found in subtrees which are formed exactly as
this node is formed, with the only difference being the string
itself. The association between the docstring in a similar tree and
the defined entity (class, function, or module) which it describes
is given by the position of the docstring subtree within the tree
defining the described structure.</p>

<p>By replacing the actual docstring with something to signify a
variable component of the tree, we allow a simple pattern matching
approach to check any given subtree for equivalence to the general
pattern for docstrings. Since the example demonstrates information
extraction, we can safely require that the tree be in tuple form
rather than list form, allowing a simple variable representation to
be <code>['variable_name']</code>. A simple recursive function can
implement the pattern matching, returning a Boolean and a
dictionary of variable name to value mappings. (See file
example.py.)</p>

</pre>

<p>Using this simple representation for syntactic variables and the
symbolic node types, the pattern for the candidate docstring
subtrees becomes fairly readable. (See file example.py.)</p>

<pre>
import symbol
import token

DOCSTRING_STMT_PATTERN = (
    symbol.stmt,
    (symbol.simple_stmt,
     (symbol.small_stmt,
      (symbol.expr_stmt,
       (symbol.testlist,
        (symbol.test,
         (symbol.and_test,
          (symbol.not_test,
           (symbol.comparison,
            (symbol.expr,
             (symbol.xor_expr,
              (symbol.and_expr,
               (symbol.shift_expr,
                (symbol.arith_expr,
                 (symbol.term,
                  (symbol.factor,
                   (symbol.power,
                    (symbol.atom,
                     (token.STRING, ['docstring'])
                     )))))))))))))))),
     (token.NEWLINE, '')
     ))
</pre>

<p>Using the <code>match</code> function
with this pattern, extracting the module docstring from the parse
tree created previously is easy:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; found, vars = match(DOCSTRING_STMT_PATTERN, tup[1])
&gt;&gt;&gt; found
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; vars
{'docstring': '"""Some documentation.\n"""'}
</pre>

<p>Once specific data can be extracted from a location where it is
expected, the question of where information can be expected needs
to be answered. When dealing with docstrings, the answer is fairly
simple: the docstring is the first <code>stmt</code> node in a code
block (<code>file_input</code> or <code>suite</code> node types). A
module consists of a single <code>file_input</code> node, and class
and function definitions each contain exactly one <code>
suite</code> node. Classes and functions are readily identified as
subtrees of code block nodes which start with <code>(stmt,
(compound_stmt, (classdef, ...</code> or <code>(stmt,
(compound_stmt, (funcdef, ...</code>. Note that these subtrees
cannot be matched by <code>match</code>
since it does not support multiple sibling nodes to match without
regard to number. A more elaborate matching function could be used
to overcome this limitation, but this is sufficient for the
example.</p>

<p>Given the ability to determine whether a statement might be a
docstring and extract the actual string from the statement, some
work needs to be performed to walk the parse tree for an entire
module and extract information about the names defined in each
context of the module and associate any docstrings with the names.
The code to perform this work is not complicated, but bears some
explanation.</p>

<p>The public interface to the classes is straightforward and
should probably be somewhat more flexible. Each &#8220;major&#8221;
block of the module is described by an object providing several
methods for inquiry and a constructor which accepts at least the
subtree of the complete parse tree which it represents. The <code>ModuleInfo</code> constructor
accepts an optional <var>name</var> parameter since it cannot
otherwise determine the name of the module.</p>

<p>The public classes include <code>ClassInfo</code>, <code>FunctionInfo</code>, and <code>ModuleInfo</code>. All objects provide the
methods <code>get_name</code>, <code>get_docstring</code>, <code>get_class_names</code>, and
<code>get_class_info</code>. The
<code>ClassInfo</code> objects support
<code>get_method_names</code>
and <code>get_method_info</code>
while the other classes provide <code>get_function_names</code> and <code>
get_function_info</code>.</p>

<p>Within each of the forms of code block that the public classes
represent, most of the required information is in the same form and
is accessed in the same way, with classes having the distinction
that functions defined at the top level are referred to as
&#8220;methods.&#8221; Since the difference in nomenclature
reflects a real semantic distinction from functions defined outside
of a class, the implementation needs to maintain the distinction.
Hence, most of the functionality of the public classes can be
implemented in a common base class, <code>SuiteInfoBase</code>, with the accessors for
function and method information provided elsewhere. Note that there
is only one class which represents function and method information;
this parallels the use of the <code>
def</code> statement to define both types of elements.</p>

<p>Most of the accessor functions are declared in <code>SuiteInfoBase</code> and do not need to be
overridden by subclasses. More importantly, the extraction of most
information from a parse tree is handled through a method called by
the <code>SuiteInfoBase</code>
constructor. The example code for most of the classes is clear when
read alongside the formal grammar, but the method which recursively
creates new information objects requires further examination. Here
is the relevant part of the <code>SuiteInfoBase</code> definition from
example.py:</p>

<pre>
class SuiteInfoBase:
    _docstring = ''
    _name = ''

    def __init__(self, tree = None):
        self._class_info = {}
        self._function_info = {}
        if tree:
            self._extract_info(tree)

    def _extract_info(self, tree):
        # extract docstring
        if len(tree) == 2:
            found, vars = match(DOCSTRING_STMT_PATTERN[1], tree[1])
        else:
            found, vars = match(DOCSTRING_STMT_PATTERN, tree[3])
        if found:
            self._docstring = eval(vars['docstring'])
        # discover inner definitions
        for node in tree[1:]:
            found, vars = match(COMPOUND_STMT_PATTERN, node)
            if found:
                cstmt = vars['compound']
                if cstmt[0] == symbol.funcdef:
                    name = cstmt[2][1]
                    self._function_info[name] = FunctionInfo(cstmt)
                elif cstmt[0] == symbol.classdef:
                    name = cstmt[2][1]
                    self._class_info[name] = ClassInfo(cstmt)
</pre>

<p>After initializing some internal state, the constructor calls
the <code>_extract_info</code>
method. This method performs the bulk of the information extraction
which takes place in the entire example. The extraction has two
distinct phases: the location of the docstring for the parse tree
passed in, and the discovery of additional definitions within the
code block represented by the parse tree.</p>

<p>The initial <code>if</code> test
determines whether the nested suite is of the &#8220;short
form&#8221; or the &#8220;long form.&#8221; The short form is used
when the code block is on the same line as the definition of the
code block, as in</p>

<pre>
def square(x): "Square an argument."; return x ** 2
</pre>

<p>while the long form uses an indented block and allows nested
definitions:</p>

<pre>
def make_power(exp):
    "Make a function that raises an argument to the exponent `exp'."
    def raiser(x, y=exp):
        return x ** y
    return raiser
</pre>

<p>When the short form is used, the code block may contain a
docstring as the first, and possibly only, <code>small_stmt</code>
element. The extraction of such a docstring is slightly different
and requires only a portion of the complete pattern used in the
more common case. As implemented, the docstring will only be found
if there is only one <code>small_stmt</code> node in the <code>
simple_stmt</code> node. Since most functions and methods which use
the short form do not provide a docstring, this may be considered
sufficient. The extraction of the docstring proceeds using the <code>match</code> function as described
above, and the value of the docstring is stored as an attribute of
the <code>SuiteInfoBase</code>
object.</p>

<p>After docstring extraction, a simple definition discovery
algorithm operates on the <code>stmt</code> nodes of the <code>
suite</code> node. The special case of the short form is not
tested; since there are no <code>stmt</code> nodes in the short
form, the algorithm will silently skip the single <code>
simple_stmt</code> node and correctly not discover any nested
definitions.</p>

<p>Each statement in the code block is categorized as a class
definition, function or method definition, or something else. For
the definition statements, the name of the element defined is
extracted and a representation object appropriate to the definition
is created with the defining subtree passed as an argument to the
constructor. The representation objects are stored in instance
variables and may be retrieved by name using the appropriate
accessor methods.</p>

<p>The public classes provide any accessors required which are more
specific than those provided by the <code>SuiteInfoBase</code> class, but the real
extraction algorithm remains common to all forms of code blocks. A
high-level function can be used to extract the complete set of
information from a source file. (See file example.py.)</p>

<pre>
def get_docs(fileName):
    import os
    import parser

    source = open(fileName).read()
    basename = os.path.basename(os.path.splitext(fileName)[0])
    ast = parser.suite(source)
    return ModuleInfo(ast.totuple(), basename)
</pre>

<p>This provides an easy-to-use interface to the documentation of a
module. If information is required which is not extracted by the
code of this example, the code may be extended at clearly defined
points to provide additional capabilities.</p>
