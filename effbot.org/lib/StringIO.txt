<h1>StringIO&#8212;Read and write strings as files</h1>

<p>This module implements a file-like class, {@link StringIO}, that
reads and writes a string buffer (also known as {@em memory files}). See
the description of file objects for operations (section {@link
bltin-file-objects.html#bltin-file-objects}).

@@class StringIO([buffer])

<p>When a {@link StringIO} object is created, it can be initialized to
an existing string by passing the string to the constructor. If no
string is given, the {@link StringIO} will start empty. In both cases,
the initial file position starts at zero.

<p>The {@link StringIO} object can accept either Unicode or 8-bit
strings, but mixing the two may take some care. If both are used, 8-bit
strings that cannot be interpreted as 7-bit ASCII (that use the 8th bit)
will cause a {@link exceptions.UnicodeError} to be raised when {@link
getvalue} is called.

<p>The following methods of {@link StringIO} objects require special
mention:

@@method StringIO.getvalue()

<p>Retrieve the entire contents of the &#8220;file&#8221; at any time
before the {@link StringIO} object's {@link close} method is called. See
the note above for information about mixing Unicode and 8-bit strings;
such mixing can cause this method to raise {@link
exceptions.UnicodeError}.

@@method StringIO.close()

<p>Free the memory buffer.
