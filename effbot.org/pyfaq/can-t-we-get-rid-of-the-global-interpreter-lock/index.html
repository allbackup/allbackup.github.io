<a href="what-is-the-global-interpreter-lock">Global Interpreter Lock</a> (GIL) is often seen as a hindrance to Python&#8217;s deployment on high-end multiprocessor server machines, because a multi-threaded Python program effectively only uses one CPU, due to the insistence that (almost) all Python code can only run while the GIL is held.</p><p>Back in the days of Python 1.5, Greg Stein actually implemented a comprehensive patch set (the &#8220;free threading&#8221; patches) that removed the GIL and replaced it with fine-grained locking. Unfortunately, even on Windows (where locks are very efficient) this ran ordinary Python code about twice as slow as the interpreter using the GIL. On Linux the performance loss was even worse because pthread locks aren&#8217;t as efficient.</p><p>Since then, the idea of getting rid of the GIL has occasionally come up but nobody has found a way to deal with the
