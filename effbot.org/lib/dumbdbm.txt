<h1>dumbdbm&#8212;Portable DBM implementation</h1>


<p class='note'><b>Note:</b> The {@link dumbdbm} module is intended as a
last resort fallback for the {@link anydbm} module when no more robust
module is available. The {@link dumbdbm} module is not written for speed
and is not nearly as heavily used as the other database modules.

<p>The {@link dumbdbm} module provides a persistent dictionary-like
interface which is written entirely in Python. Unlike other modules such
as {@link gdbm} and {@link bsddb}, no external library is required. As
with other persistent mappings, the keys and values must always be
strings.

<p>The module defines the following:

@@exception error

<p>Raised on dumbdbm-specific errors, such as I/O errors. {@link
exceptions.KeyError} is raised for general mapping errors like
specifying an incorrect key.

@@function open(filename[, flag[, mode]])

<p>Open a dumbdbm database and return a dumbdbm object. The {@var
filename} argument is the basename of the database file (without any
specific extensions). When a dumbdbm database is created, files with
.dat and .dir extensions are created.

<p>The optional {@var flag} argument is currently ignored; the database
is always opened for update, and will be created if it does not exist.

<p>The optional {@var mode} argument is the Unix mode of the file, used
only when the database has to be created. It defaults to octal {@code
0666} (and will be modified by the prevailing umask).
<blockquote>
@since Changed in version 2.2: The mode argument was ignored in
earlier versions. <br />
