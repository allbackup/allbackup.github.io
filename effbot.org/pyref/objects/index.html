All data in a Python
program is represented by objects or by relations between objects. (In
a sense, and in conformance to Von Neumann&#8217;s model of a <q>stored
program computer,</q> code is also represented by objects.)</p><p>Every object has an identity, a type and a value. An object&#8217;s
<em>identity</em> never changes once it has been created; you may think of it
as the object&#8217;s address in memory. The <a href="is.htm"><strong>is</strong></a> operator compares the
identity of two objects; the <a href="id.htm"><strong>id</strong></a> function returns an integer
representing its identity (currently implemented as its address). An
object&#8217;s <em>type</em> is also unchangeable.</p><p>(However, since Python 2.2, a gradual merging of types and classes has
been started that makes this and a few other assertions made in this
manual not 100% accurate and complete: for example, it <em>is</em> now
possible in some cases to change an object&#8217;s type, under certain
controlled conditions. Until this manual undergoes extensive revision,
it must now be taken as authoritative only regarding <q>classic
classes</q>, that are still the default, for compatibility purposes, in
Python 2.2 and 2.3. For more information, see
<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/newstyle.html">http://www.python.org/doc/newstyle.html</a>).</p><p>An object&#8217;s type determines the operations that the object supports
(e.g., <q>does it have a length?</q>) and also defines the possible
values for objects of that type. The <a href="type.htm"><strong>type</strong></a> function returns an
object&#8217;s type (which is an object itself). The <em>value</em> of some objects
can change. Objects whose value can change are said to be <em>mutable</em>;
objects whose value is unchangeable once they are created are called
<em>immutable</em>. (The value of an
