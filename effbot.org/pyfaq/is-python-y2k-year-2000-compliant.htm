Python generally represents times either as seconds since 1970 or as a (year, month, day, &#8230;) tuple where the year is expressed with four digits, which makes Y2K bugs unlikely. So as long as your C library is okay, Python should be okay. Of course, it&#8217;s possible that a particular application written in Python makes assumptions about 2-digit years.</p><p>Because Python is available free of charge, there are no absolute guarantees. If there <em>are</em> unforeseen problems, liability is the user&#8217;s problem rather than the developers&#8217;, and there is nobody you can sue for damages.
