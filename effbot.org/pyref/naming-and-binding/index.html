Names are introduced by name binding
operations. Each occurrence of a name in the program text refers to
the <em>binding</em> of that name established in the innermost function block
containing the use.</p><p>A <em>block</em> is a piece of Python program text that is executed as a
unit. The following are blocks: a module, a function body, and a class
definition. Each command typed interactively is a block. A script file
(a file given as standard input to the interpreter or specified on the
interpreter command line the first argument) is a code block. A script
command (a command specified on the interpreter command line with the
<strong>-c</strong> option) is a code block. The file read by the built-in
function <a href="execfile.htm"><strong>execfile</strong></a> is a code block. The string argument passed to the
built-in function <a href="eval.htm"><strong>eval</strong></a> and to the <a href="exec.htm"><strong>exec</strong></a> statement is a code
block. The expression read and evaluated by the built-in function
<a href="input.htm"><strong>input</strong></a> is a code block.</p><p>A code block is executed in an <em>execution frame</em>. A frame contains
some administrative information (used for debugging) and determines
where and how execution continues after the code block&#8217;s execution has
completed.</p><p>A <em>scope</em> defines the visibility of a name within a block. If a local
variable is defined in a block, its scope includes that block. If the
definition occurs in a function block, the scope extends to any blocks
contained within the defining one, unless a contained block introduces
a different binding for the name. The scope of names defined in a
class block is limited to the class block; it does not extend to the
code blocks of methods.</p><p>When a name is used in a code block, it is resolved using the nearest
enclosing scope. The set of all such scopes visible to a code block is
called the block&#8217;s <em>environment</em>.</p><p>If a name is bound in a block, it is a local variable of that
block. If a name is bound at the module level, it is a global
variable. (The variables of the module code block are local and
global.) If a variable is used in a code block but not defined there,
it is a <em>free variable</em>.</p><p>When a name is not found at all, a <a href="NameError.htm"><strong>NameError</strong></a> e
