Here&#8217;s the original introduction:</p><blockquote><p>This reference manual describes the Python programming language. It is
  not intended as a tutorial.</p><p>While I am trying to be as precise as possible, I chose to use English
  rather than formal specifications for everything except syntax and
  lexical analysis. This should make the document more understandable to
  the average reader, but will leave room for ambiguities. Consequently,
  if you were coming from Mars and tried to re-implement Python from
  this document alone, you might have to guess things and in fact you
  would probably end up implementing quite a different language. On the
  other hand, if you are using Python and wonder what the precise rules
  about a particular area of the language are, you should definitely be
  able to find them here. If you would like to see a more formal
  definition of the language, maybe you could volunteer your time &#8212; or
  invent a cloning machine :-).</p><p>It is dangerous to add too many implementation details to a language
  reference document &#8212; the implementation may change, and other
  implementations of the same language may work differently. On the
  other hand, there is currently only one Python implementation in
  widespread use (although alternate implementations exist), and its
  particular quirks are sometimes worth being mentioned, especially
  where the implementation imposes additional limitations. Therefore,
  you&#8217;ll find short <q>implementation notes</q> sprinkled throughout the
  text.</p><p>Every Python implementation comes with a number of built-in and
  standard modules. These are not documented here, but in the separate
  <em><a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/lib.html">Python Library Reference</a></em>
  document. A few built-in modules are mentioned when they interact in a
  significant way with the language definition.</p></blockquote></div><div class="yui-u">&#160;</div></div><div class="yui-g"></div> <!-- yui-g --></div> <!-- content --> </div> <!-- yui-b --> </div> <!-- yui-main --> <div class="yui-b"> <div id='menu'> <ul> <li><b><a href="/" title="Go to effbot.org.">::: effbot.org</a></b></li> <li><b><a href="." title="Go to pyref index page.">::: pyref :::</a></b></li> </ul> </div> <!-- menu --> </div> <!-- yui-b --> </div> <!-- bd --> <div id="ft"> <!-- footer --> <p><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/"><img src="/media/img/djangosite80x15.gif" border="0" alt="A Django site." title="A Django site." style="vertical-align: bottom;"></a>
