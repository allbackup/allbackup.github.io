<h1>gopherlib&#8212;Gopher protocol client</h1>

<p>This module provides a minimal implementation of client side of the
Gopher protocol. It is used by the module {@link urllib} to handle URLs
that use the Gopher protocol.

<p>The module defines the following functions:

@@function send_selector(selector, host[, port])

<p>Send a {@var selector} string to the gopher server at {@var host} and
{@var port} (default {@code 70}). Returns an open file object from which
the returned document can be read.

@@function send_query(selector, query, host[, port])

<p>Send a {@var selector} string and a {@var query} string to a gopher
server at {@var host} and {@var port} (default {@code 70}). Returns an
open file object from which the returned document can be read.

@@text 

<p>Note that the data returned by the Gopher server can be of any type,
depending on the first character of the selector string. If the data is
text (first character of the selector is "{@code 0}"), lines are
terminated by CRLF, and the data is terminated by a line consisting of a
single "{@code .}", and a leading "{@code .}" should be stripped from
lines that begin with "{@code ..}". Directory listings (first character
of the selector is "{@code 1}") are transferred using the same protocol.
