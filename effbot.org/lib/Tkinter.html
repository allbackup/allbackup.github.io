<h2 id="tkinter-modules">Tkinter Modules <a class="nav" href="#tkinter-modules">#</a></h2>

<p>Most of the time, the <code>
Tkinter</code> module is all you really need, but a number of
additional modules are available as well. The Tk interface is
located in a binary module named <code>_tkinter</code>. This module contains the
low-level interface to Tk, and should never be used directly by
application programmers. It is usually a shared library (or DLL),
but might in some cases be statically linked with the Python
interpreter.</p>

<p>In addition to the Tk interface module, <code>Tkinter</code> includes a number of Python
modules. The two most important modules are the <code>Tkinter</code> module itself, and a module called
<code>Tkconstants</code>. The former
automatically imports the latter, so to use Tkinter, all you need
to do is to import one module:</p>

<pre>
import Tkinter
</pre>

<p>Or, more often:</p>

<pre>
from Tkinter import *
</pre>
</div>
<dl><dt class="class" id="Tk"><b>class Tk(screenName=None, baseName=None, className='Tk',

<dd class="class">
<p>The <a class="link" href="#Tk"><code>Tk</code></a> class is instantiated
without arguments. This creates a toplevel widget of Tk which
usually is the main window of an application. Each instance has its
own associated Tcl interpreter.</p>

<dd class="function">
<p>The <a class="link" href="#Tcl"><code>Tcl</code></a> function is a
factory function which creates an object much like that created by
the <a class="link" href="#Tk"><code>Tk</code></a> class, except that it
does not initialize the Tk subsystem. This is most often useful
when driving the Tcl interpreter in an environment where one
doesn't want to create extraneous toplevel windows, or where one
cannot (i.e. Unix/Linux systems without an X server). An object
created by the <a class="link" href="#Tcl"><code>Tcl</code></a> object can
have a Toplevel window created (and the Tk subsystem initialized)
by calling its <code>loadtk</code>
method.</p>

<h3>How To Use This Section</h3>

<p>This section is designed in two parts: the first half (roughly)
covers background material, while the second half can be taken to
the keyboard as a handy reference.</p>

<p>When trying to answer questions of the form &#8220;how do I do
blah&#8221;, it is often best to find out how to
do&#8220;blah&#8221; in straight Tk, and then convert this back
into the corresponding <code>
Tkinter</code> call. Python programmers can often guess at the correct
Python command by looking at the Tk documentation. This means that
in order to use Tkinter, you will have to know a little bit about
Tk. This document can't fulfill that role, so the best we can do is
point you to the best documentation that exists. Here are some
hints:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The authors strongly suggest getting a copy of the Tk man pages.
Specifically, the man pages in the <code>mann</code> directory are
most useful. The <code>man3</code> man pages describe the C
interface to the Tk library and thus are not especially helpful for
script writers.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Addison-Wesley publishes a book called <em>Tcl and the Tk
Toolkit</em> by John Ousterhout (ISBN 0-201-63337-X) which is a
good introduction to Tcl and Tk for the novice. The book is not
exhaustive, and for many details it defers to the man pages.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Tkinter.py is a last resort for most, but can be a good place to
go when nothing else makes sense.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>A Simple Hello World Program</h3>

from Tkinter import *

class Application(Frame):
    def say_hi(self):
        print "hi there, everyone!"

    def createWidgets(self):
        self.QUIT = Button(self)
        self.QUIT["text"] = "QUIT"
        self.QUIT["fg"]   = "red"
        self.QUIT["command"] =  self.quit

        self.QUIT.pack({"side": "left"})

        self.hi_there = Button(self)
        self.hi_there["text"] = "Hello",

<h2 id="a-very-quick-look-at-tcl-tk">A (Very) Quick Look at Tcl/Tk <a class="nav" href="#a-very-quick-look-at-tcl-tk">#</a></h2>

<p>The class hierarchy looks complicated, but in actual practice,
application programmers almost always refer to the classes at the
very bottom of the hierarchy.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>These classes are provided for the purposes of organizing
certain functions under one namespace. They aren't meant to be
instantiated independently.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <a class="link" href="#Tk"><code>Tk</code></a> class is meant to be
instantiated only once in an application. Application programmers
need not instantiate one explicitly, the system creates one
whenever any of the other classes are instantiated.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <code>Widget</code> class is not
meant to be instantiated, it is meant only for subclassing to make
&#8220;real&#8221; widgets (in C++, this is called an `abstract
class').</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>To make use of this reference material, there will be times when
you will need to know how to read short passages of Tk and how to
identify the various parts of a Tk command. (See section <code>
tkinter-basic-mapping.html#tkinter-basic-mapping</code> for the <code>Tkinter</code> equivalents of what's
below.)</p>

<p>Tk scripts are Tcl programs. Like all Tcl programs, Tk scripts
are just lists of tokens separated by spaces. A Tk widget is just
its <em>class</em>, the <em>options</em> that help configure it,
and the <em>actions</em> that make it do useful things.</p>

<p>To make a widget in Tk, the command is always of the form:</p>

<pre>
                classCommand newPathname options
</pre>
</div>
<dl><dt class="variable" id="options"><b>options</b> <tt class="nav"><a class="nav" href="Tkinter.options" title="bookmark">#</a>|<a class="nav" href="#" title="edit/suggest changes">!</a>|<a class="nav" href="#" title="search for related examples">&amp;</a></tt></dt>

<dd class="variable">
<p>configure the widget's appearance and in some cases, its
behavior. The options come in the form of a list of flags and
values. Flags are proceeded by a `-', like unix shell command
flags, and values are put in quotes if they are more than one
word.</p>
</dd>
</dl><div class="text">
<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
    button   .fred   -fg red -text "hi there"
       ^       ^     \_____________________/
       |       |                |
     class    new            options
    command  widget  (-opt val -opt val ...)
</pre>

<p>Once created, the pathname to the widget becomes a new command.
This new <var>widget command</var> is the programmer's handle for
getting the new widget to perform some <var>action</var>. In C,
you'd express this as someAction(fred, someOptions), in C++, you
would express this as fred.someAction(someOptions), and in Tk, you
say:</p>

<pre>
    .fred someAction someOptions
</pre>

<p>Note that the object name, <code>.fred</code>, starts with a
dot.</p>

<p>As you'd expect, the legal values for <var>someAction</var> will
depend on the widget's class: <code>.fred disable</code> works if
fred is a button (fred gets greyed out), but does not work if fred
is a label (disabling of labels is not supported in Tk).</p>

<p>The legal values of <var>someOptions</var> is action dependent.
Some actions, like <code>disable</code>, require no arguments,
others, like a text-entry box's <code>delete</code> command, would
need arguments to specify what range of text to delete.</p>

<h2 id="mapping-basic-tk-into-tkinter">Mapping Basic Tk into Tkinter <a class="nav" href="#mapping-basic-tk-into-tkinter">#</a></h2>

<p>Class commands in Tk correspond to class constructors in
Tkinter.</p>

<pre>
    button .fred                =====&gt;  fred = Button()
</pre>

<p>The master of an object is implicit in the new name given to it
at creation time. In Tkinter, masters are specified explicitly.</p>

<pre>
    button .panel.fred          =====&gt;  fred = Button(panel)
</pre>

<p>The configuration options in Tk are given in lists of hyphened
tags followed by values. In Tkinter, options are specified as
keyword-arguments in the instance constructor, and keyword-args for
configure calls or as instance indices, in dictionary style, for
established instances. See section <code>
tkinter-setting-options.html#tkinter-setting-options</code> on setting
options.</p>

<pre>
    button .fred -fg red        =====&gt;  fred = Button(panel, fg = "red")
    .fred configure -fg red     =====&gt;  fred["fg"] = red
                                OR ==&gt;  fred.config(fg = "red")
</pre>

<p>In Tk, to perform an action on a widget, use the widget name as
a command, and follow it with an action name, possibly with
arguments (options). In Tkinter, you call methods on the class
instance to invoke actions on the widget. The actions (methods)
that a given widget can perform are listed in the Tkinter.py
module.</p>

<pre>
    .fred invoke                =====&gt;  fred.invoke()
</pre>

<p>To give a widget to the packer (geometry manager), you call pack
with optional arguments. In Tkinter, the Pack class holds all this
functionality, and the various forms of the pack command are
implemented as methods. All widgets in <code>Tkinter</code> are subclassed from the Packer, and
so inherit all the packing methods. See the <code>Tix</code> module documentation for additional
information on the Form geometry manager.</p>

<pre>
    pack .fred -side left       =====&gt;  fred.pack(side = "left")
</pre>

<h3>Setting Options</h3>

<p>Options control things like the color and border width of a

<dd class="variable">
<p>:</p>

<pre>
fred.config(fg = "red", bg = "blue")
</pre>
</dd>
</dl><div class="text">
<p>For a complete explanation of a given option and its behavior,
see the Tk man pages for the widget in question.</p>

<p>Note that the man pages list "STANDARD OPTIONS" and "WIDGET
SPECIFIC OPTIONS" for each widget. The former is a list of options
that are common to many widgets, the latter are the options that
are ideosyncratic to that particular widget. The Standard Options
are documented on the options(3) man page.</p>

<p>No distinction between standard and widget-specific options is
made in this document. Some options don't apply to some kinds of
widgets. Whether a given widget responds to a particular option
depends on the class of the widget; buttons have a <code>
command</code> option, labels do not.</p>

<p>The options supported by a given widget are listed in that
widget's man page, or can be queried at runtime by calling the <code>config</code> method without
arguments, or by calling the <code>
keys</code> method on that widget. The return value of these calls is
a dictionary whose key is the name of the option as a string (for
example, <code>'relief'</code>) and whose values are 5-tuples.</p>

<p>Some options, like <code>bg</code> are synonyms for common
options with long names (<code>bg</code> is shorthand for
"background"). Passing the <code>config()</code> method the name of
a shorthand option will return a 2-tuple, not 5-tuple. The 2-tuple
passed back will contain the name of the synonym and the
&#8220;real&#8221; option (such as <code>('bg',
'background')</code>).</p>

<h3>The Packer</h3>

<p>The packer is one of Tk's geometry-management mechanisms.</p>

<p>Geometry managers are used to specify the relative positioning
of the positioning of widgets within their container - their mutual
<em>master</em>. In contrast to the more cumbersome <em>placer</em>
(which is used less commonly, and we do not cover here), the packer
takes qualitative relationship specification - <em>above</em>, <em>
to the left of</em>, <em>filling</em>, etc - and works everything
out to determine the exact placement coordinates for you.</p>

<p>The size of any <em>master</em> widget is determined by the size
of the "slave widgets" inside. The packer is used to control where
slave widgets appear inside the master into which they are packed.
You can pack widgets into frames, and frames into other frames, in
order to achieve the kind of layout you desire. Additionally, the
arrangement is dynamically adjusted to accommodate incremental
changes to the configuration, once it is packed.</p>

<p>Note that widgets do not appear until they have had their
geometry specified with a geometry manager. It's a common early
mistake to leave out the geometry specification, and then be
surprised when the widget is created but nothing appears. A widget
will appear only after it has had, for example, the packer's <code>pack</code> method applied to it.</p>

<p>The pack() method can be called with keyword-option/value pairs
that control where the widget is to appear within its container,
and how it is to behave when the main application window is
resized. Here are some examples:</p>

<pre>
    fred.pack()                     # defaults to side = "top"
    fred.pack(side = "left")
    fred.pack(expand = 1)
</pre>

<h3>Packer Options</h3>

<p>For more extensive information on the packer and the options
that it can take, see the man pages and page 183 of John
Ousterhout's book.</p>
</div>
<dl><dt class="variable" id="side"><b>side</b> <tt class="nav"><a class="nav" href="Tkinter.side" title="bookmark">#</a>|<a class="nav" href="#" title="edit/suggest changes">!</a>|<a class="nav" href="#" title="search for related examples">&amp;</a></tt></dt>

<dd class="variable">
<p>Legal values are: <code>'left'</code>, <code>'right'</code>,
<code>'top'</code>, <code>'bottom'</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl><div class="text">
<h3>Coupling Widget Variables</h3>

<p>The current-value setting of some widgets (like text entry
widgets) can be connected directly to application variables by
using special options. These options are <code>variable</code>,
<code>textvariable</code>, <code>onvalue</code>, <code>
offvalue</code>, and <code>value</code>. This connection works both
ways: if the variable changes for any reason, the widget it's
connected to will be updated to reflect the new value.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in the current implementation of <code>Tkinter</code> it is not possible to hand over an
arbitrary Python variable to a widget through a <code>
variable</code> or <code>textvariable</code> option. The only kinds
of variables for which this works are variables that are subclassed
from a class called Variable, defined in the <code>Tkinter</code> module.</p>

<p>There are many useful subclasses of Variable already defined: <code>StringVar</code>, <code>IntVar</code>, <code>DoubleVar</code>, and <code>BooleanVar</code>. To read the current value of
such a variable, call the <code>get</code>
method on it, and to change its value you call the <code>set</code> method. If you follow this protocol, the
widget will always track the value of the variable, with no further
intervention on your part.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
class App(Frame):
    def __init__(self, master=None):
        Frame.__init__(self, master)
        self.pack()
        
        self.entrythingy = Entry()
        self.entrythingy.pack()
        
        # here is the application variable
        self.contents = StringVar()
        # set it to some value
        self.contents.set("this is a variable")
        # tell the entry widget to watch this variable
        self.entrythingy["textvariable"] = self.contents
        
        # and here we get a callback when the user hits return.
        # we will have the program print out the value of the
        # application variable when the user hits return
        self.entrythingy.bind('&lt;Key-Return&gt;',
                              self.print_contents)

    def print_contents(self, event):
        print "hi. contents of entry is now ----&gt;", \
              self.contents.get()
</pre>

<h3>The Window Manager</h3>

<p>In Tk, there is a utility command, <code>wm</code>, for
interacting with the window manager. Options to the <code>wm</code>
command allow you to control things like titles, placement, icon
bitmaps, and the like. In <code>
Tkinter</code>, these commands have been implemented as methods on the
<code>Wm</code> class. Toplevel widgets are
subclassed from the <code>Wm</code> class,
and so can call the <code>Wm</code> methods
directly.</p>

<p>To get at the toplevel window that contains a given widget, you
can often just refer to the widget's master. Of course if the
widget has been packed inside of a frame, the master won't
represent a toplevel window. To get at the toplevel window that
contains an arbitrary widget, you can call the <code>_root</code> method. This method begins with an
underscore to denote the fact that this function is part of the
implementation, and not an interface to Tk functionality.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of typical usage:</p>

<pre>
from Tkinter import *
class App(Frame):
    def __init__(self, master=None):
        Frame.__init__(self, master)
        self.pack()


# create the application
myapp = App()

#
# here are method calls to the window manager class
#
myapp.master.title("My Do-Nothing Application")
myapp.master.maxsize(1000, 400)

# start the program

<h3>Bindings and Events</h3>

<p>The bind method from the widget command allows you to watch for
certain events and to have a callback function trigger when that
event type occurs. The form of the bind method is:</p>

<pre>
    def bind(self, sequence, func, add=''):
</pre>

<p>where:</p>
</div>
<dl><dt class="variable" id="add"><b>add</b> <tt class="nav"><a class="nav" href="Tkinter.add" title="bookmark">#</a>|<a class="nav" href="#" title="edit/suggest changes">!</a>|<a class="nav" href="#" title="search for related examples">&amp;</a></tt></dt>

<dd class="variable">
<p>is optional, either "" or "<code>+</code>". Passing an empty
string denotes that this binding is to replace any other bindings
that this event is associated with. Preceeding with a
"<code>+</code>" means that this function is to be added to the
list of functions bound to this event type.</p>
</dd>
</dl><div class="text">
<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
    def turnRed(self, event):
        event.widget["activeforeground"] = "red"

    self.button.bind("&lt;Enter&gt;", self.turnRed)
</pre>

<p>Notice how the widget field of the event is being accessed in
the <code>turnRed</code> callback. This
field contains the widget that caught the X event. The following
table lists the other event fields you can access, and how they are
denoted in Tk, which can be useful when referring to the Tk man
pages.</p>

<pre>
Tk      Tkinter Event Field             Tk      Tkinter Event Field 
--      -------------------             --      -------------------
%f      focus                           %A      char
%h      height                          %E      send_event
%k      keycode                         %K      keysym
%s      state                           %N      keysym_num
%t      time                            %T      type
%w      width                           %W      widget
%x      x                               %X      x_root
%y      y                               %Y      y_root
</pre>

<h3>The index Parameter</h3>

<p>A number of widgets require&#8220;index&#8221; parameters to be
passed. These are used to point at a specific place in a Text
widget, or to particular characters in an Entry widget, or to
particular menu items in a Menu widget.</p>
</div>
<dl><dt class="variable" id="Menu"><b>Menu indexes (menu.invoke(), menu.entryconfig(),
etc.)</b> <tt class="nav"><a class="nav" href="Tkinter.Menu" title="bookmark">#</a>|<a class="nav" href="#" title="edit/suggest changes">!</a>|<a class="nav" href="#" title="search for related examples">&amp;</a></tt></dt>

<dd class="variable">
<p>Some options and methods for menus manipulate specific menu
entries. Anytime a menu index is needed for an option or a
parameter, you may pass in:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>an integer which refers to the numeric position of the entry in
the widget, counted from the top, starting with 0;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>the string <code>'active'</code>, which refers to the menu
position that is currently under the cursor;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>the string <code>"last"</code> which refers to the last menu
item;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>An integer preceded by <code>@</code>, as in <code>@6</code>,
where the integer is interpreted as a y pixel coordinate in the
menu's coordinate system;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>the string <code>"none"</code>, which indicates no menu entry at
all, most often used with menu.activate() to deactivate all
entries, and finally,</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>a text string that is pattern matched against the label of the
menu entry, as scanned from the top of the menu to the bottom. Note
that this index type is considered after all the others, which
means that matches for menu items labelled <code>last</code>,
<code>active</code>, or <code>none</code> may be interpreted as the
above literals, instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl><div class="text">
<h3>Images</h3>

<p>Bitmap/Pixelmap images can be created through the subclasses of
<code>Tkinter.Image</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>BitmapImage</code> can be
used for X11 bitmap data.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><code>PhotoImage</code> can be
used for GIF and PPM/PGM color bitmaps.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Either type of image is created through either the <code>
file</code> or the <code>data</code> option (other options are
available as well).</p>

<p>The image object can then be used wherever an <code>image</code>
option is supported by some widget (e.g. labels, buttons, menus).
In these cases, Tk will not keep a reference to the image. When the
last Python reference to the image object is deleted, the image
data is deleted as well, and Tk will display an empty box wherever
the image was used.</p>
