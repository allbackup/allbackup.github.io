<h1>test&#8212;Regression tests package for Python</h1>

<div class="toc"><dl><dt>On this page:</dt><dd><a href="#writing-unit-tests-for-the-test-package">Writing Unit Tests for the test package</a></dd><dd><a href="#running-tests-using-test-regrtest">Running tests using test.regrtest</a></dd></dl></div><p>The <code>test</code> package contains
all regression tests for Python as well as the modules <code>test.test_support</code>
and <code>test.regrtest</code>. <code>test.test_support</code> is
used to enhance your tests while <code>test.regrtest</code> drives the testing
suite.</p>

<p>Each module in the <code>test</code>
package whose name starts with "<code>test_</code>" is a testing
suite for a specific module or feature. All new tests should be
written using the <code>unittest</code>
module; using <code>unittest</code> is
not required but makes the tests more flexible and maintenance of
the tests easier. Some older tests are written to use <code>doctest</code> and a
&#8220;traditional&#8221; testing style; these styles of tests will
not be covered. <span class="mark">@see</span> <code>Module unittest</code> Writing PyUnit regression
tests. <span class="mark">@see</span> <code>Module doctest</code> Tests embedded in
documentation strings.</p>

<h2 id="writing-unit-tests-for-the-test-package">Writing Unit Tests for the test package <a class="nav" href="#writing-unit-tests-for-the-test-package">#</a></h2>

<p>It is preferred that tests for the <code>test</code> package use the <code>unittest</code> module and follow a few
guidelines. One is to have the name of all the test methods start
with "<code>test_</code>" as well as the module's name. This is
needed so that the methods are recognized by the test driver as
test methods. Also, no documentation string for the method should
be included. A comment (such as "<code># Tests function returns
only True or False</code>") should be used to provide documentation
for test methods. This is done because documentation strings get
printed out if they exist and thus what test is being run is not
stated.</p>

<p>A basic boilerplate is often used:</p>

<pre>
import unittest
from test import test_support

class MyTestCase1(unittest.TestCase):

    # Only use setUp() and tearDown() if necessary

    def setUp(self):
        ... code to execute in preparation for tests ...

    def tearDown(self):
        ... code to execute to clean up after tests ...

    def test_feature_one(self):
        # Test feature one.
        ... testing code ...

    def test_feature_two(self):
        # Test feature two.
        ... testing code ...

    ... more test methods ...

class MyTestCase2(unittest.TestCase):
    ... same structure as MyTestCase1 ...

... more test classes ...

def test_main():
    test_support.run_unittest(MyTestCase1,
                              MyTestCase2,
                              ... list other tests ...
                             )

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_main()
</pre>

<p>This boilerplate code allows the testing suite to be run by <code>test.regrtest</code> as well as
on its own as a script.</p>

<p>The goal for regression testing is to try to break code. This
leads to a few guidelines to be followed:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The testing suite should exercise all classes, functions, and
constants. This includes not just the external API that is to be
presented to the outside world but also "private" code.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Whitebox testing (examining the code being tested when the tests
are being written) is preferred. Blackbox testing (testing only the
published user interface) is not complete enough to make sure all
boundary and edge cases are tested.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Make sure all possible values are tested including invalid ones.
This makes sure that not only all valid values are acceptable but
also that improper values are handled correctly.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Exhaust as many code paths as possible. Test where branching
occurs and thus tailor input to make sure as many different paths
through the code are taken.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Add an explicit test for any bugs discovered for the tested
code. This will make sure that the error does not crop up again if
the code is changed in the future.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Make sure to clean up after your tests (such as close and remove
all temporary files).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Import as few modules as possible and do it as soon as possible.
This minimizes external dependencies of tests and also minimizes
possible anomalous behavior from side-effects of importing a
module.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Try to maximize code reuse. On occasion, tests will vary by
something as small as what type of input is used. Minimize code
duplication by subclassing a basic test class with a class that
specifies the input:</p>

<pre>
class TestFuncAcceptsSequences(unittest.TestCase):

    func = mySuperWhammyFunction

    def test_func(self):
        self.func(self.arg)

class AcceptLists(TestFuncAcceptsSequences):
    arg = [1,2,3]

class AcceptStrings(TestFuncAcceptsSequences):
    arg = 'abc'

class AcceptTuples(TestFuncAcceptsSequences):
    arg = (1,2,3)
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<span class="mark">@see</span> <cite>Test Driven Development</cite>
A book by Kent Beck on writing tests before code. 

<h2 id="running-tests-using-test-regrtest">Running tests using test.regrtest <a class="nav" href="#running-tests-using-test-regrtest">#</a></h2>

<p><code>test.regrtest</code> can
be used as a script to drive Python's regression test suite.
Running the script by itself automatically starts running all
regression tests in the <code>test</code>
package. It does this by finding all modules in the package whose
name starts with "<code>test_</code>", importing them, and
executing the function <code>
test_main</code> if present. The names of tests to execute may also be
passed to the script. Specifying a single regression test (python
regrtest.py test_spam.py) will minimize output and only print
whether the test passed or failed and thus minimize output.</p>

<p>Running <code>
test.regrtest</code> directly allows what resources are available for
tests to use to be set. You do this by using the -u command-line
option. Run python regrtest.py -uall to turn on all resources;
specifying all as an option for -u enables all possible resources.
If all but one resource is desired (a more common case), a
comma-separated list of resources that are not desired may be
listed after all. The command python regrtest.py
-uall,-audio,-largefile will run <code>test.regrtest</code> with all resources
except the audio and largefile resources. For a list of all
resources and more command-line options, run python regrtest.py
-h.</p>

<p>Some other ways to execute the regression tests depend on what
platform the tests are being executed on. On Unix, you can run make
test at the top-level directory where Python was built. On Windows,
executing rt.bat from your PCBuild directory will run all
regression tests.</p>
