=============================
The sgmlop accelerator module
=============================

The sgmlop module provides an optimized SGML/XML parser, designed as
an add-on to the sgmllib/htmllib and xmllib modules shipped with
Python 1.5 and later.

This driver is typically 5-10 times faster than the original xmllib
implementation.  When using sgmlop's native interface, it can be more
than 50 times faster.

However, sgmlop is (by design) a very tolerant parser.  It will parse
virtually anything into a stream of start tags, entities, end tags,
and text sections.  If you need careful well-formedness checking, use
expat instead.

changes from 1.0 (latest first)
-------------------------------

(The following list may be somewhat incomplete)

- Inside attribute values, character references larger than 255
  are now passed to resolve_entityref (as '#nnnn').

- Fixed segmentation violation when parsing non-ASCII character
  entities in attribute values (reported and fixed by Jeff Chan).

(1.1 released)

- Fixed potential segmentation violation when parsing non-ASCII
  character entities.

(1.1 beta 2 released)

- Fixed garbage support for Python 2.2 and later.  (Thanks to Neal
  Schemenauer for pointing out the problems with the approach used
  in 1.1 beta 1, and providing improved compatibility macros).

- Fixed parsing of target-only PI's (reported by Walter Dörwald).

(1.1 beta 1 released)

- Added support for garbage collection, under Python 2.0 and
  later.  Under 1.5.2, you must still make sure to call the
  close method on all parser instances.

- Changed behaviour for character references that doesn't fit
  in an 8-bit character.  Basically, you must define a charref
  handler (handle_charref) if you're interested in such data.

(1.1 alpha 3 released)

- Repaired parsing of &lt;empty/&gt; tags that didn't have a white-
  space between the tag name and the slash; the non-ASCII change
  in alpha 1 broke this, and the test suite didn't catch the bug.
  (reported by Matthew King)

(1.1 alpha 2 released)

- Entities in attributes are now properly resolved.  Standard
  entities (amp, apos, gt, lt, quot) and character entities always
  work; other entities are mapped through the resolve_entityref
  callback (see below).

- Added brief documentation (module-sgmlop.html, sgmlop.css)

(1.1 alpha 1 released)

- A new callback, resolve_entityref, has been added.  This handler
  is called for named entities if the handle_entityref callback
  isn't defined.  This callback will also be used to resolve
  entities in attributes.

  If neither resolve_entityref or handle_entityref are defined,
  but handle_data is defined, sgmlop generates character data for
  the standard entities (amp, apos, gt, lt, quot).

- Hexadecimal character references are now supported.

- Malformed character references (&amp;#nnn;) are treated as ordinary
  entities, if handle_charref isn't defined.

- The XML tag and entity parsers now treats all characters above
  chr(128) as letters, independent of the current locale.  This
  should make it easier to use sgmlop with non-ASCII characters
  in tags.

- sgmlop now resolves standard entities (apos, quot, gt, lt, amp)
  by itself, if handle_entityref isn't defined.

- SGML files containing text only wasn't properly handled.  the parser
  never consumed the last character, not even if the 'close' method
  was called (reported by Walter Dörwald)

- Unicode strings (under 1.6) were treated as binary buffers.  In this
  release, the parser can properly parse 16-bit strings, but the
  callbacks get 8-bit UTF-8 strings, not true Unicode strings.  This
  will be fixed in a future release.

- The 'close' method no longer accepts an optional argument.  Use a
  separate call to 'feed' instead.

- Recursive calls to 'feed' or 'close' (from within a callback) could
  lead to all sorts of weird problems.  This version checks for this
  condition, and raises an AssertionError instead.
